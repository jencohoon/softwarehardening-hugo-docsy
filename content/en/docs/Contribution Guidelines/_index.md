## Github account

A Github.com account is required to make contributions to the documentation.
[Github Hello World!](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) provides a basic introduction to GitHub concepts and workflow.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
Consult [GitHub About Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

## Updating a document with Github

Each Documentation page has a shortcut that links to the webpage's source code in Github.  This makes it easy to propose a changes as soon as they're spotted. Here is a shortcut:

1. Click **Github page source** in the top right hand corner of the page. This will open a new tab and load the Github.com page source.
1. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click **Fork this repository and propose changes** or **Update your Fork** to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode.
1. Click the edit icon (a pencil symbol).  This will reload the Github page into edit mode.
1. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR).  All Security Guide documents are written in Markdown.

## Creating an issue

If you've found a problem in the docs, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, [please create an issue in Github](https://github.com/jzinner/softwarehardening-hugo-docsy/issues). Creating an issue also requires a Github account.
