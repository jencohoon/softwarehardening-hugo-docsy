Our mission is to inform, educate, and organize the public to engage in software hardening. Software hardening is the act of securing a computer system, making it less vulnerable to unauthorized access, abuse of resources, or theft of information.

Our mission falls under the US charitable classifications of: education, public saftey, and research.

Currently, security advice is scattered over many sources. Instead of being actionable, much of the writing targets the publicâ€™s fear of security exposure.  Most security advice is presented on websites whose business model is to generate ad-views, which are designed to be clumsy to page through as each page view counts as a separate ad view, or websites where content is hidden behind a pay wall.

The US public is permeated with computers. While millions of applications and programs run on those devices, the public has only a few choices of operating system for phone, notebook, and desktop computers.

Those operating systems are designed to serve many sectors: education, government, industry, and also personal use. Because of the varied markets served, operating systems do not come with usage guidelines or security recommendations. The other sectors employ security engineers and IT teams to protect computers and data, but the public does not have access to these resources.

</div>

While most of the public is aware they are responsible for security of their personal devices, understanding and making informed decisions about security settings often requires expert knowledge of operating systems, networking, and software design which is inaccessible for much of the public.

As operating systems change, with frequent updates and new versions released, the effort and time required to understand new and altered security settings makes it difficult for the expert public to stay current with security settings.

The Foundation for Software Hardening was organized to fill the urgent need for charitable action to aid the public in securing their digital privacy by: 

 -  Encouraging the public to take action rather than arousing public fear, and providing a clean, simple website, free of advertising 
 - Providing actionable security guides, written to be accessible to an interested layperson
 - Employing expert knowledge of operating systems, networking, and software design to research and test operating system security.
