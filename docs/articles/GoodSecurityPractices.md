In this article on "Good Security Practices," we discuss the reasons behind our security recommendations.  We separated explinations of "Good Security Practices" from the step-by-step "Hardening Guidelines" to make the Guidelines more readable and keep the Guidelines as actionable as possible.

We recognize some readers want to understand "why", this article is designed for them.  



### Users

Running a secure operating system involves actively managing Users.  With access to a User account on the operating system, it's possible to: access data stored on the local computer, access other devices connected to the same network, alter security settings, or install compromised or malicious software.   

Because of this, someone with access to a User account can potentially 1) monitor and read what you type on your keyboard and 2) access any data stored on your local filesystem.  They can potentially read and modify information on authenticated websites, including your web-based email and your social media accounts.  They can launch attacks targeting other devices on your network. 

Fortunately, operating systems come with built-in User management features that are very thorough and easy to apply.  When configuring User managment, here are the security principle's to guide decision making:

1. *__It is good security practice to restrict the creation of new User accounts or restrict new Users from logging in.__*
2. *__It is good security practice to require Users to authenticate.__* 
3. *__It is good security practice to log out users when the computer is unattended.__*
4. *__It is good security practice to require administrator authentication to update security settings.__*
5. *__Itâ€™s good security practice to use an external organization method for passwords.__*
